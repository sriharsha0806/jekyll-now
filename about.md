I have completed my graduation from Florida Institute of Technology. I majored in Electrical Engineering with specialization in signal processing. I’ve had two research internships in my career, one at Bhabha Atomic Research Center and one at the Satish Dhawan Space Research Center. 

During my undergraduation, I worked on a student satellite project. For further information about the project check out the following link [parikshit.org](http://parikshit.org/)

Currently working on Robotics and Self Driving Car Nanodegree programs of Udacity. Completed first term of Self Driving Car.
